#Introduction

The company is based in Chicago. Their bike-share program features over 5,800 bicycles that are geo tracked and locked into a network of 692 docking stations across Chicago. The companyâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. These pricing plans helped the company categorize its customers into two types;
Casual Riders: Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes
Members Riders: Customers who purchased annual memberships
The finance analysts concluded that Member riders are much more profitable than Casual riders and the manager believed that maximizing the number of Members Riders will be key to future growth. The manager also believed that rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, there is a very good chance to convert Casual riders into Members Riders.
As the data analyst, I was tasked to identify how member riders and casual riders use bikes differently by analyzing historical bike trip data.
